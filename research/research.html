<h3> Current Research: </h3> I mainly work on the following projects at the moment. 


</li></ul>

<ul><li><b> The cooperations algebra for topological modular forms </b><br>
	This is part of an ongoing endeavor to develop machinery to make the tmf-based Adams spectral sequence as a viable tool for doing computations in stable homotopy theory, especially for computing the homotopy of the sphere. At the moment, I am mainly focusing on the cooperations algebra for tmf at the prime p=3.
</li></ul>

<!--<ul><li><b> The telescope conjecture (Joint with Agnes Beaudry, Mark Behrens, Prasit Bhattacharya, Doug Ravenel, and Zhouli Xu)</b><br>
	In this project, we are attempting to find a counter example to Ravenel's (now infamous) telescope conjecture. 
</li></ul>-->

<ul><li><b> Motivic kq-resolutions over general base fields (Joint with JD Quigley)</b><br>
	We are studying the kq-based Adams spectral sequence over general base fields, extending our previous work over the field of complex numbers. 
</li></ul>

<!--<ul><li><b> On the cohomology of the Morava Stabilizer Group on the divided envelope of Lubin-Tate Space (Joint with Paul Van Koughnett)</b><br>
	In their seminal paper, Devinatz and Hopkins give a description of the action of the Morava Stabilizer group on the divided envelope of Lubin-Tate space. Paul and I are trying to compute the group cohomology of this action. 
</li></ul>-->


<h3> In progress: </h3>

<!--<ul><li><b> Towards the 3-primary co-operations algebra for topological modular forms</b><br>
	We use the Adams spectral sequence in tmf modules to calculate the 3-primary homotopy of $\tmf\wedge \tmf$ in a finite range . 
</li></ul>-->

<!--<ul><li><b> The BP<2>-resolution for V(1) at primes at least 5</b><br>
	We adapt techniques as developed by Beaudry-Behrens-Bhattacharya-Culver-Xu to study the BP<2>-resolution for the Smith-Toda complex V(1) at large primes. 
</li></ul>-->


<ul><li><b> The structure of the $v_2$-local algebraic tmf resolution (joint with Mark Behrens and Prasit Bhattacharya)</b><br>
	We give a complete description of the $E_1$-page of the $v_2$-local algebraic tmf resolution. 
</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Algebraic K-theory of Elliptic Cohomology (with Gabe Angelini-Knoll, Christian Ausoni, Eva H&ouml;ning, and John Rognes) </b><br>
	We compute the $V(2)$-homotopy of the algebraic K-theory of the second truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum.

<ul><li><b> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07479" target="_blank" >The Motivic Lambda algebra</a> (joint with J.D. Quigley and W. Balderrama)</b><br>
	We give a description of the motivic Lambda algebra over general base fields. We recover various calculations of Ext over the motivic Steenrod algebra and use these to determine an infinite family of $d_2$-differentials out of the 1-line in the R-motivic ASS.

<li><b> <a href="tmfASSZ.pdf" target="_blank"> The telescope conjecture at height 2 and the tmf resolution</a> (Joint with Behrens, Beaudry, Bhattacharya, and Xu). Accepted. To appear in the Journal of Topology</b><br>
We analyze the tmf-based Adams spectral sequence for the type 2 spectrum Z.  This is used to deduce that the K(2)-local Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, whose E_2-term was computed by Bhattacharya-Egger, collapses.  We also explore how this spectral sequence detects the telescopic homotopy of Z.

	Using Hopkins' construction of the spectrum tmf in the K(1)-local category, we compute the K(1)-local tmf cooperations.

<li> <b> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11952" targe = "_blank">kq-resolutions I</a> (Joint with JD Quigley). Accepted. To appear in Trans. AMS</b><br>
	We compute the cooperations of the very effective cover of Hermitian K-theory over the complex numbers. We use this to analyze the kq-resolution and prove complex motivic analogs of Mahowald's results using bo-resolutions, such as the order of the 2-torsion in the image of J. We also formulate and provide evidence for a motivic Telescope Conjecture.
