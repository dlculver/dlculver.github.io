Under Review\nWe give a complete description of the (E_1)-page of the (v_2)-local algebraic tmf resolution.\n\n\n\nPublications & Preprints\n\nAlgebraic K-theory of Elliptic Cohomology (with Gabe Angelini-Knoll, Christian Ausoni, Eva Höning, and John Rognes). Accepted, to appear in Geometry and Topology\nWe compute the (V(2))-homotopy of the algebraic K-theory of the second truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum.\nExotic K(h)-local Picard groups when 2p-1=h^2 and the Vanishing Conjecture (joint with Ningchuan Zhang). Accepted.\nThe Motivic Lambda algebra (joint with J.D. Quigley and W. Balderrama). Accepted, to appear in Geometry and Topology\nWe give a description of the motivic Lambda algebra over general base fields. We recover various calculations of Ext over the motivic Steenrod algebra and use these to determine an infinite family of (d_2)-differentials out of the 1-line in the R-motivic ASS.\nTopological Hochschild Homology of the second truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum, part 1 (Joint with Gabe Angelini-Knoll and Eva Höning)\nAlgebraic Slice Spectral Sequences (Joint with H. Kong and J.D. Quigley). Accepted. To appear in Documenta Mathematica\nThe telescope conjecture at height 2 and the tmf resolution (Joint with Behrens, Beaudry, Bhattacharya, and Xu). Accepted. To appear in the Journal of Topology\nWe analyze the tmf-based Adams spectral sequence for the type 2 spectrum Z. This is used to deduce that the K(2)-local Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, whose E2-term was computed by Bhattacharya-Egger, collapses. We also explore how this spectral sequence detects the telescopic homotopy of Z.\nK(1)-local tmf co-operations (Joint with Paul VanKoughnett). Accepted. To appear in JHRS\nUsing Hopkins’ construction of the spectrum tmf in the K(1)-local category, we compute the K(1)-local tmf cooperations.\nkq-resolutions I (Joint with JD Quigley). Accepted. To appear in Trans. AMS\nWe compute the cooperations of the very effective cover of Hermitian K-theory over the complex numbers. We use this to analyze the kq-resolution and prove complex motivic analogs of Mahowald’s results using bo-resolutions, such as the order of the 2-torsion in the image of J. We also formulate and provide evidence for a motivic Telescope Conjecture.\nThe Adams spectral sequence for 3-local tmf. Accepted. To appear in JHRS.\nLast updated 10/08/2020\nThe BP&lt;2&gt;-cooperations algebra at odd primes. JPAA 224 (May 2020)\nLast updated 9/20/19\nOn BP&lt;2&gt;-cooperations. Algebraic & Geometric Topology 19 (2019) 807-862\nOn the E2-term of the bo-Adams spectral sequence. J. Topology 13 (2020) 356-415.\n(with Mark Behrens, Agnes Beaudry, Prasit Bhattacharya, and Zhouli Xu). Last updated 2/1/17.\nA new basis for complex K-theory cooperations algebra.

    "text": "About Me\nI am a mathematician by training and I got my PhD in 2017 from the University of Notre Dame. I then went on to do postdocs first at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and then another postdoc at the Max-Planck-Institüt für Mathematik. My mathematical research interests were all within what is known as stable homotopy theory, and I was particular interested in using ideas around elliptic curves and modular forms to understand complex structures in the stable homotopy groups of spheres.\nIn 2023, I decided to take the leap and transition into tech. I worked at an early legal AI startup for a year and half where I learned a lot of cool things about software and LLMs. My current interests are around ML and AI broadly, and NLP and LLMs more specifically. I am interested in building new and exciting things with these technologies while also using mathematical background to better understand LLMs in theory.\nI am currently looking for new opportunities which utilize my mathematical and research background and within AI/ML. I am also always happy to collaborate or discuss research ideas, please feel free to peruse my website and reach out!"
