    "text": "About Me\nI am a mathematician by training and I got my PhD in 2017 from the University of Notre Dame. I then went on to do postdocs first at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and then another postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn Germany. My mathematical research interests were all within stable homotopy theory, and I was particularly interested in using ideas around elliptic curves and modular forms to understand complex structures in the stable homotopy groups of spheres.\nIn 2023, I decided to take the leap and transition into tech. I worked at an early legal AI startup for a year and half where I learned a lot of cool things about software and LLMs. My current interests are around ML and AI broadly, and NLP and LLMs more specifically. I am interested in building new and exciting things with these technologies while also using mathematical background to better understand LLMs in theory.\nI currently work at Northwestern Medicine where I work as a MLE. I am also always happy to collaborate or discuss research ideas, please feel free to peruse my website and reach out!\nBelow you can find links to my blog, mathematical research articles, courses I taught, and notes from talks I gave:\n\nBlog - Thoughts and insights on math, AI, and technology\nResearch Papers and Preprints\nTeaching\nNotes & Talks"

    "text": "About Me\nI completed my PhD in mathematics in 2017 at the University of Notre Dame, where I worked with Mark Behrens and wrote a thesis in stable homotopy theory. After that, I did two postdocs: one at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and another at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany. My research focused primarily on chromatic homotopy theory broadly, and on using the spectrum of topological modular forms to understand the stable homotopy groups of spheres in particular. During my time in academia, I taught a variety of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, including algebra, topology, and homotopy theory.\nIn 2023, I made the decision to transition from academia to the tech industry. I joined an early-stage legal AI startup where I worked on building AI systems and applications. I got to work on a lot of cool things with cool people, and I learned a lot about software development, machine learning, and natural language processing. It is amazing to think about how far AI has come in just a few years, and I am excited to be part of this rapidly evolving field."

For now, I will be writing predominately about different papers I encounter in the wild, interesting developments in the field, and my personal experiences and insights as I continue to learn and grow in this new domain.\nComments and feedback are always welcome, and I hope to foster a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about AI, machine learning, and the intersection of these fields with mathematics.\nHappy reading, and stay tuned for more posts!
