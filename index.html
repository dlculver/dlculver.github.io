	 <h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> I am a mathematician who has recently pivoted towards industry. I currently work for a startup as a ML/AI research scientist, specifically within the domain of NLP. Before that,  I was a postdoc at the 
			<a href="https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute for Mathematics</a>
			in Bonn, Germany. 
			Mathematically, I am a homotopy theorist who was  particularly interested in chromatic homotopy theory (topological modular forms in particular) and motivic homotopy theory.. <br> <br>
